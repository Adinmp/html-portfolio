<h3>Pride and prejudice</h3>
<p>I used to underestimate this movie because of how simple the official movie poster was. I was wrong, and yet this is my favorite romance movie of all time. It's just wholesome and pure, and maybe someday I'll find my own Mr. Darcy ;). </p>

<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>Sci-fi is my least favorite movie genre honestly. But this is the most memorable movie that I watched with my ex. Something melancony about it, like I stare into the future of a humankind, which is quite sad and tragic.</p>

<h3>Scent of Woman</h3>
<p>What unexpected movie, it made me like a cry baby. Actually, this movie is about post-power syndrome and delusion due to loneliness + prolonged sadness. It reminds me of grandpa.</p>
