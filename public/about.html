<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<p>Warm greetings everyone, this is Adinda speaking or (writing)! I'm a former banker who's aspire to become a UI/UX designer. 
  I actually decided learning about the web development to get better understanding on product design and to be more well-rounded
  designer. I'm so passionate about the behind the scene of how a design made and written in programming languages then to be lauched on the real website or app. 
</p>

<p>During my spare time, I enjoy writing on my medium.com page (mostly about fashion + beauty), and cooking or baking delicious 
  cuisine from around the world. I'll attach the link if you want to check that out!
</p>

<p>I'm determined to be better at this, so feel free to give me a feedback or comments on my first-ever portfolio. Thanks for visiting this website
  I hope you have a great day!
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Cheers! <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Adinda
